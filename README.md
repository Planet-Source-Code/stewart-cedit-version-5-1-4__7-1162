## cEdit Version 5\.1\.4


</div>

### Description

cEdit is an OpenSource Code Editor. Originally it was written in Visual Basic, but has been ported to Borland Delphi 6 Personal Edition. This is one of the most complete editors on PSC I believe, and has a huge number of features available. It uses synedit to achieve the syntax highlighting, but this is only one portion of what cEdit can do. Unfortunatly the file size of the download is pretty large, running almost 15MB. Because of this I am unable to upload directly to psc so I've included a direct link to the source below off the sourceforge website. I emailed the psc owners asking them if possible to post the source for me.

Please note the components for the app are all located in the components directory. Some of them are by me, others I can not claim credit for. Browse threw, most of them came with readme's so you can see who deserves credit where.
